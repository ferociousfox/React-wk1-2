# React

* What is ReactJS?
_React is a JS library used to create dynamic views. It solves the prolbem of slow load times caused by large blocks of HTML._


* History
_React was developed by FaceBook in 2011 for use in the newsfeed area, which was having issues with slow load times. They billed it as a "JavaScript library for building user interfaces."_

_Instagram integrated react in 2012 and it was released as an open source technology in May of 2013._

## ReactJS vocabulary

**Views** : _the part of my apps the user acutally sees on the screen. AKA the User Interface or view layer. It manages how the user interfaces look ad behave, while remaining unconcerned with the back-end of an application._

**Library** : _Frameworks, like Angular, include some built-in functionalities for things like client-side routing or loading/saving/editing data from a database. React is only concerned with the view layer. Tools that offer a single facet of functionality like this are called libraries. They're usually integrated alongside other libraries and tools to create a customized stack that meets the needs of the particular project._

**Highy-Dynamic** : _This simply refers to views that need to change and update **a** **lot**. React allows us to automatically, dynamically update the UI quickly, without reloading the page. So, any application or site that requires frequent, speedy updates is a great candidate for React._

## What makes React great

* Component-Based
  _Like Angular, React is Component-based. this assists in orgainzing even the most complex user interfaces into small packages of dedicated functionality. also these components are reusable aiding us in keeping it DRY._

* Declarative
  _this means we write code that describes the intended end result, but not every step required to reach that result. For example, HTML is declarative. we don't define every pixel, just the end result. Declarative code is widely considered more reusable, readable, and easier for programmers to collaborate on._

* Data Model Synchronization
  _React includes built-in functionality to automatically synchronize our data models with our user interface. That means when we update a piece of data in our application (**called state** ...), we can code our user interface to automatically update to reflect that change._

* Virtual DOM
  _For now, this allows us to interact with the DOM more efficiently, with much less code than other libraries and frameworks._

* Easier to Create Single Page Applications
  _with Multiple page applications, each time a user requests information, a new page must load. Most modern webpages are a single page on the other-hand. despite being large applications such as facebook. They load a single page and dynamically update that sole page as necessary. the creates a snappier, smoother user experience due to the reduced number of page refreshes. this allows the user to complete multiple actions without navigating to a new page. These can be more difficult to create and maintain. The DOM needs to me updated constantly. The data and the user interface must continually be synchronized. But thanks to React's virtual DOM, and data model synchronization capabilities, React makes creating these modern apps much easier._

* JSX
  _A special syntax which allows developers to mix HTML with JavaScript._

* Support
  _React is also maintained by facebook and Instagram. so it will likely continue to be maintained and curated into the foreseeable future._

* Library Benefits
  _this offers us massive flexibility in defining the other parts of their application and stack to fit the specific needs of their app or website._

* React Native and VR
  _React native is for building mobile-friendly applications with React. React VR is a framework for building VR apps using React and JS... NEAT_
