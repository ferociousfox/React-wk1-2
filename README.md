# React homework Documentation

_specs_
 * you will find my notes in notes.md documenting what i focused on during my time spent studying.
 * i built the app out of the homework, BUT i must have missed a step becuase it wont serve. i am done for the day but would really like to look at the app with you and see what is missing.
 * this was an extremely helpful practice and i will likely use this structure again to study/do homework.
